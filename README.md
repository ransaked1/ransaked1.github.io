# VAVE Landing Page

Vave was a [Bump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bump_(application))-like app I worked on while participating at the Startup School organised by Orange. The goal was to store social media credentials and contact details and share them both online and offline via NFC/bluetooth at social events for convinience, speed and practicality. This is the landing page concept I developed as part of the concept.

You can have a look at it [here](https://ransaked1.github.io/).
